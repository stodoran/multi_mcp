Options to consider:
1. Convert entire codebase to async (queue, workers, scheduler)
2. Use run_in_executor() to bridge async/sync boundary
3. Separate async scheduler from sync worker pool with thread-safe queue
4. Replace asyncio scheduler with threading-based approach

Consider: backwards compatibility, performance, complexity, testing effort.
Provide a clear recommendation at the end.
